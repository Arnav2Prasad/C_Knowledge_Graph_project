# Knowledge_Graph

This project puts forward a fundamental kernel-level implementation of a KG. The proposed system demonstrates that querying a KG, which stores millions of data points, is remarkably fast.

The structure of the KG is designed to ensure that accurate relationships are provided for given queries, achieving 100% accuracy.

The present work can be improved by integrating KG with NLP, which would enable the construction of KG from un-structured data.

We are open to new ideas and enhancement for the project. Feel free to contact us!
