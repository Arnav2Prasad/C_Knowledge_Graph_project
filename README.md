# Knowledge_Graph

The project aimed to construct a knowledge graph based on the input data, Knowledge graph is an entity relationship model where nodes are entity and edges represents relation. 

We implemented a scalable and efficient organization of data using appropriate data structures. Once we fire a query, the desired output will not take more than a sec :)

Currently the Knowledge Graph is taking structured input, but we are planning soon to take it into Natural Language Processing (NLP).

We are open to new ideas and enhancement for the project. Feel free to contact us!
